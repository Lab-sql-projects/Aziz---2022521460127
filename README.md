# DreamScape Nexus

## Project Description
DreamScape Nexus is an innovative database system designed to map the intricate landscape of human dreams. This platform serves as a digital repository where dreamers can document their nocturnal journeys, creating a collective atlas of subconscious experiences. The system captures the ephemeral nature of dreams through detailed recording, categorization, and analysis of dream narratives, symbols, and emotional resonances.

The database consists of four main entities:
- **Users**: Individuals who record their dreams
- **DreamCategories**: Classifications of different dream types
